    <h1>wakandoski</h1>
    
    <p>Wakanda was based primarily on the southern African country 
        Lesotho, an enclave that had historically only lightly
        been colonised by the British because of its terrain. Much of the 
        production style was also based on architecture from Uganda, Rwanda, Burun
        di, D.R.C. and Ethiopia </p>
